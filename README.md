# Email Spam Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories using machine learning techniques. The increasing volume of spam emails necessitates efficient filtering mechanisms to safeguard users' inboxes.

## Objectives
- To build a robust spam classification model.
- To implement various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for users to test the spam filter.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of spam and non-spam emails, sourced from publicly available datasets. The emails are labeled accordingly for training and testing purposes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedsamymohamad/email_spam_classification.git
